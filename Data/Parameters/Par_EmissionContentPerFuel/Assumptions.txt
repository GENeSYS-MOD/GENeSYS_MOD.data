Umweltbundesamt CO2 EF list 2022:
Data given in t/TJ. Convertet to Mt/PJ by a factor of 10^-3.
Assumed the value for LNG equal to Gas_Natural.

For the fuel "Air", "ETS" and "ETS_Source":
These are all dummies that are used to track CO2 emissions for various use cases. 

- “Air” is a dummy that direct air capture plants use. The amount of “Air” / CO2 that is stored is computed via this fuel. 

- "ETS" and "ETS Source" work the following: 
	In cases where there are different emission limits for different countries, the fuel "ETS" and "ETS Source" 
	are used to see what happens if regions could trade these CO2 allowances. 
	ETS stands for Emission Trading System and is a fuel that is a dummy that removes emissions from one region and trades 
	them to another region. 
	This is set up in a way that the “ETS” are essentially coupons for CO2 emissions that come from a source (ETS_Source), 
	where they cause emissions, and then remove emissions when “redeemed”.
