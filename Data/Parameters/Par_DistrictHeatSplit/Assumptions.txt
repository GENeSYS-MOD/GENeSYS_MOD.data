Took the split for 2018 from final Energy consumption of district heating in 2018 from "EU Commission: District Heating and Cooling in the European Union".
Years until 2025 remain on the same Level. For future years, the factor is lowered for both Buildings and Industry not summing up to 1 anymore, thus giving the model some freedom of choice on where to use the district heat.

See calculation file for the calculations.
