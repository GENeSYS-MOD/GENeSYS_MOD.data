For EU countries, assumed to keep the same ratio between 2020 and 2050 demand as EU Reference Scenario 2020. Linear growth between.
Calculation is as follows:
Demand_y = Demand_2020 + (Demand_2020*(Demand_EU_2050/Demand_EU_2020) - Demand_EU_2020)*((y - 2020) / (2050 - 2020))
where y = year for which the demand is specified

In general:
	- Assumed 2015 = 2018. Interpolated values for the years not given in the TYNDP source.

Parameters:
	- Heat_Buildings: 
	
	TYNDP 2022 Scenario Report: OUTPUT_ALL -> Scenario: Distributed Energy -> Sector: Residential + Tertiary -> Subsector: Space_heating + Water_heating -> 
	Energy_carrier: All -> Output_type: Energy_demand.
	
	Heat_Buildings = Heat_Buildings_TYNDP22 - Heat_District
	
	- Heat_Industrial: 
	
	TYNDP 2022 Scenario Report: OUTPUT_ALL -> Scenario: Distributed Energy -> Sector: Industry -> Subsector: Low_enthalpy_heat + Steam_processes + Other_processes -> 
	Energy_carrier: All -> Output_type: Energy_demand
	
	The total industrial heat demand from TYNDP22 are divided in Low_Industrial (<100 degrees), MediumLow_Industrial (100-150 degrees), MediumHigh_Industrial (150-1000 degrees) 
	and High_Industrial (>1000 degrees) based on temperature ranges for different energy sectors from "Potential for steam regeneration in Norwegian industry" 
	and Eurostat data for "Final consumption industry sector*".
	Assumed the same temperature range per industry sectors for all countries and no develompent from 2018 to 2050.
	Assumed equal percetage of Low, MediumLow, MediumHigh and High in CH and DE.
	
	Heat_Low_Industrial = Heat_Low_Industrial_estimated - DistrictHeat_Industrial
	
	* The sector "Not elsewhere specified" is divided 50/50 into the sectors "Wood and wood products" and "Textiles and leather" because the sector includes products of both 
	  wood and textiles (e.g. Manufacture of furniture and Manufacture of musical instruments) and we assume therefore same temperature ranges.
	
	- Heat_District:
	
	EU Comission: District Heating and Cooling in the European Union -> 1 DH Consumption 
	
	DistrictHeat_Building follows a deveopment from "District heating potenial in the EU-27" for the years 2020 - 2050. Interpolated values for the years not given. 
	Assumed no develompment in the DistrictHeat_Industrial - needs update.
	
	Heat_District = DistrictHeat_Building + DistrictHeat_Industrial

	- H2:
	
	Scenarios for EU EnVis-2060 scenarios follow the following rule:
		- Historic data is taken from European Hydrogen Observatory (2023), which is kept towards the future, as this is currently fossil H2 demand which will potentially need to be replaced by renewable hydrogen sources
		- Future data is based on the TYNDP 2022 Scenario Report:
			- EU Trinity assumes the National Trends Scenario
			- NECP Essentials and REPowerEU++ assume the Global Ambition Scenario
			- Go RES assumes the Distributed Energy Scenario
			- The TYNDP scenario results are added on top of the historic existing hydrogen demands
