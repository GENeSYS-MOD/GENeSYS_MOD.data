Generated time-based temperature profiles for each country.

Assumptions:
- The temperature profile of the capital represents the country
- Outside temperatur > 18 C -> zero heat demand -> no HP in operation
	- To make the model run the values equal to 0 are set to the lowest existing value (0.100628878).
- Set point temperature for HP = 20 C
- Pinch point in the heat exchanger = 5 K
- Carnot efficiency = 0.4

COP = (set point temperature + pinch point) / ((set point temperature + pinch point) - (outside temperature - pinch point)) * carnot efficiency
