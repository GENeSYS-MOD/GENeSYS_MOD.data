Generated time-based temperature profiles for each country.

Assumptions:
- The time-specific COP is calculated based on desired indoor and outdoor temperatures.
- Then, each individual hour value is normed to the mean, which creates a timeseries that varies around the base value of 100%.
- A value of e.g. 120% would thus mean that in the particular hour, the heat pump uses 120% more energy than on average.
- The average efficiencies for heat pumps are given in the parameters (InputActivityRatio)
