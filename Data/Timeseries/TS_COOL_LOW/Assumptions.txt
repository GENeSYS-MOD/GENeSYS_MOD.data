Hotmaps was used to generate the TS_COOL_LOW . The inputs values were time-based temerature profiles and NUTS-numbers.

The time-based temperature profiles for each country were generated from Renewable Ninja.The temperature profile of the capital represents the country

The NUTS2-numbers were selected based on the location of the capital in each country. 
For capitals/countries not represented in Hotmaps, nearby countries/regions were used. 
- BG: NUTS2 = RO32
- GR: NUTS2 = EL64 - Central Greece, Athen not representet in Hotmaps
- HR: NUTS2 = HR03 - Zagreb not representet in Hotmaps
- HU: NUTS2 = HU10 - Budapest not representet in Hotmaps
- NO: NUTS2 = SE11 - Norway not represented in Hotmaps
- TR: NUTS2 = RO32 - Turkey not represented in Hotmaps

The cooling profiles generated from Hotmaps were then normalized to creat the TS_COOL_LOW.
