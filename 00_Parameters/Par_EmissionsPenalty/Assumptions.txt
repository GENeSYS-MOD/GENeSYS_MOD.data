OpenENTRANCE: Quantitative Scenarios for Low Carbon Futures of the European Energy System on Country, Region and Local Level
- Deliverable NO.3.2 (see section 2.1.2.3)

The CO2 prices are assumptions, generated by model iterations over different price levels, aiming at 100% decarbonization in 
2040 for the Techno-Friendly scenario.
The emissions were fixed to be zero in 2040. Then the marginals were used and several iterations to obtain a CO2 price that 
would reach that goal of zero emissions in 2040. The remaining values have been interpolated. Anything after 2040 has been 
increased in line with the discount rate to keep real emission costs the same height.

See the OpenENTRANCE - Deliverable NO.3.1 section 2.1, footnote 5 for a description of how the values for the projects four 
scenarios were computed.
